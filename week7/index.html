    <h1>Week 7 Notes</h1>

    <p>I liked the console, at first I didn't get it that much when I just started but with time and looking at the uses
        tutors and teachers I prefer it. Nevertheless, the first one I learned about was in JavaScript and the braking
        points, it is really interesting and I found it the best when I am creating a script with calculations or the
        passing of variables data to build something else, with the braking points I can stop by the crucial moments
        where the data must pass to move forward and allow the program to run. You can see clearly if the calculations
        are running correctly and if is passing the right information to the next part of the process. </p>
