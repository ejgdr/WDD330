    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <main>
        <p>The work done for this week was most to set up our projects on GitHub,
            also we got to read "Doing Stuff with Web Things" by Lee S. Barney where
            we studied the section related to localstorage where I followed an
            exercise to show the point.
