    <h1>Week 2 - 5 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>On this week, I focused on my book practice. Until week 4 the book practice is covered </p>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <p>I followed specifically chapter 7 events, because they were not difficult but first time like I had the
        opportunity to use them for that long. Normally we solve many things with CSS, and was very instructive on this
        way, if with CSS we find the importance of using classes and ids as needed with events much more. Pseudo code is
        kind of still abstract to me (I also used it only sometimes in CSS), so it was a good reading too. </p>

    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <p>Forms are used for entering data into a browser. In other classes I heard about JS not being the best for
        validation to the client side because it can be disabled on purpose to mess up the project. Now Node.js for
        example, is used for the server side. Then, is it safe the building of full projects using JavaScript as unique
        language?<br><br>

        form.elements looks really handy to navigate over the details obtained through a form and manipulate them with
        loops.<br><br>

        Object-Oriented Programming is a way to structure code in a way that each part of the components in a program,
        can be reusable, easier of maintaining, and set a base to add more functionalities to it.<br><br>

        Please let me know if I got these right. Key-words: encapsulation (give the client a solution without showing
        how itâ€™s done, it uses objects, modules, methods to offer that solution to be implemented in a project as
        needed), polymorphism (when we use a process-like a method-offered to create a behavior that has been already
        created, even when they can be two different objects, also has the ability of nullify -if needed- some of the
        properties to be better adapted to the new one), inheritance (the use of capabilities for an object to create
        better versions of that object or one totally new but with similar behaviors), constructor (is when we push the
        start button of an object or the way how we try to use the capsule of code), and instance(is how we take the
        constructor to our project, there we will implement what we need from it, and will add the new thing to make it
        unique).<br><br>

        Modular JavaScript to me is like the use of encapsulation Turbo version ðŸ˜Š is like building a whole project and
        each component that gives a behavior is contained in a module, it is very independent to the point that can be
        substituted by other to maybe improve performance (for example) without the need of modifying other pieces of
        the project. It was really interesting. </p>

    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <p>I liked the console, at first I didn't get it that much when I just started but with time and looking at the uses
        tutors and teachers I prefer it. Nevertheless, the first one I learned about was in JavaScript and the braking
        points, it is really interesting and I found it the best when I am creating a script with calculations or the
        passing of variables data to build something else, with the braking points I can stop by the crucial moments
        where the data must pass to move forward and allow the program to run. You can see clearly if the calculations
        are running correctly and if is passing the right information to the next part of the process. </p>
